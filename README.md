# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains all of my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), a platform for practicing coding problems across a variety of categories such as algorithms, data structures, and system design. These solutions are written in various programming languages (mainly C++) and are organized by problem difficulty and category.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on difficulties and problem:
- **Difficulties**:
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Hard

- **Problem**:
  - **1.** Two Sum
  - **9.** Palindrome Number
  - **13.** Roman to Integer
  - **169.** Majority Element
  - **2423.** Remove Letter to Equalize Frequency
  - ... (and more)


Each solution includes the following:
- The problem statement (copied from LeetCode).
- Relevent topics covered by the problem.
- Personal notes regarding approach and thought process
- Time and space complexity analysis of the solution.

### Example Structure:
```
📂 LeetCode/
├── 📁 Easy/
│   ├── 📁 1. Two Sum/
│   └── 📁 169. Majority Element/
│       ├── solution1.cpp

```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Djazy-Faradj/LeetCode.git
   ```

2. **Browse Solutions**:
   Navigate through the folders to find the solutions for specific problems you're interested in. Each Python file is named after the problem or has an easily recognizable name.

3. **View Problem Explanation**:
   The top of each Python file includes the problem statement, an explanation of the solution approach, and the complexity analysis.

## Languages Used
Currently, most solutions are implemented in **C++**. Future plans include adding solutions in other languages, such as:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

## I plan on doing..
- **More Problems**: Continue adding solutions for newly solved problems.
- **Optimizations**: Improve existing solutions for better time and space efficiency.
