# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains all of my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), a platform for practicing coding problems across a variety of categories such as algorithms, data structures, and system design. These solutions are written in various programming languages (mainly C++) and are organized by problem difficulty and category.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on problem categories and difficulties:
- **Categories**:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graphs
  - Trees
  - ... (and more)

- **Difficulties**:
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Hard

Each solution includes the following:
- The problem statement (copied from LeetCode).
- The approach and thought process used to solve the problem.
- Time and space complexity analysis of the solution.

### Example Structure:
```
📂 LeetCode-Solutions/
├── 📁 Arrays/
│   ├── easy_two_sum.cpp
│   └── medium_product_of_array_except_self.py
├── 📁 Strings/
│   ├── easy_valid_anagram.cpp
│   └── hard_longest_substring_without_repeating.cpp
...
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Djazy-Faradj/LeetCode.git
   ```

2. **Browse Solutions**:
   Navigate through the folders to find the solutions for specific problems you're interested in. Each Python file is named after the problem or has an easily recognizable name.

3. **View Problem Explanation**:
   The top of each Python file includes the problem statement, an explanation of the solution approach, and the complexity analysis.

## Languages Used
Currently, most solutions are implemented in **C++**. Future plans include adding solutions in other languages, such as:
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript

## Contributions
Feel free to open pull requests if you would like to contribute to this repository with alternative solutions, optimizations, or solutions in different languages.

## I plan on doing..
- **More Problems**: Continue adding solutions for newly solved problems.
- **Optimizations**: Improve existing solutions for better time and space efficiency.
